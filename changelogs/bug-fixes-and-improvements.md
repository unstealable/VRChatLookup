# Bug Fixes & Changelog System Improvements

This release addresses critical bugs in the changelog system and implements improvements for better performance and SEO.

## Bug Fixes

### Metadata Generation Issues
- **JSON Parsing Error**: Fixed `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'` caused by invalid API fetch during build
- **Build-Time Optimization**: Removed problematic server-side fetch from metadata generation
- **SEO Metadata**: Improved dynamic metadata generation for individual changelog pages

### URL Structure Improvements
- **SEO-Friendly URLs**: Implemented filename-based routing (e.g., `/changelogs/bug-fixes-and-improvements`)
- **Clean URLs**: Removed date prefixes from URLs while maintaining chronological sorting
- **Better Indexing**: Enhanced search engine optimization with descriptive URL paths

## System Improvements

### Enhanced Sorting
- **Multi-Level Sorting**: Implemented year → month → day priority sorting
- **Consistent Ordering**: Ensures newest changelogs appear first in all contexts
- **Performance**: Optimized sorting algorithm for better response times

### Metadata Optimization
- **Static Generation**: Improved metadata generation for build-time optimization
- **Localized Content**: Maintained language-specific metadata without API dependencies
- **Canonical URLs**: Proper canonical URL generation for SEO compliance

These fixes ensure a stable and performant changelog system that scales with the project's growth.
